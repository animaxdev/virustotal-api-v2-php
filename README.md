PHP Script for Accessing VirusTotal API Version 2.0

[PHP script for accessing VirusTotal public API Version 2.0](http://www.ab-weblog.com/en/php-script-for-accessing-virustotal-api-version-2-0/) thanks to Andreas Breitschopp ([@abtools](https://www.virustotal.com/user/abtools/])).

VirusTotal's Public API lets you upload and scan files, submit and scan URLs, access finished scan reports and make automatic comments on URLs and samples without the need of using the HTML website interface. In other words, it allows you to build simple scripts to access the information generated by VirusTotal.

The chosen format for the API is HTTP POST requests with JSON object responses and it is limited to at most 4 requests of any nature in any given 1 minute time frame. If you run a honeyclient, honeypot or any other automation that is going to provide resources to VirusTotal and not only retrieve reports you are entitled to a higher request rate quota, ask for it at [contact@virustotal.com] and you will receive special privileges when performing the calls to the API. Note that you will only have a higher request rate quota when asking for files or URLs that you previously sent to VirusTotal.

In this second version we have improved the response format so as to ease the task of retrieving results, we have also introduced batch requests, you may now ask for several items with a sole API call (as long as you cohere with the request rate limit).
